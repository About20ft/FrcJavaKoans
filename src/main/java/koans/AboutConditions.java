    /**
     * Create a method named 'sign' which has a parameter for an integer number, and returns a text:
     * 
     * - if the number is greater or equal than zero, returns the text "positive"
     * - if the number is lesser than zero, returns the text "negative"
     * 
     * ---------   TIPS --------------
     * 
     * You can execute code depending on a condition. Conditions between 2 numbers can be expressed this way:
     * 
     *     4 == 4
     *       ^
     *    equality
     * 
     *     4 != 4
     *        ^
     *    inequality
     * 
     *     4 > 3
     *       ^
     *  greater than
     * 
     *     4 >= 3
     *       ^
     * greater than or equal
     * 
     *     4 < 3
     *       ^
     *   lesser than
     * 
     *     4 <= 3
     *       ^
     *  lesser than or equal
     * 
     * To use a condition in your code, you can use a if / else statement. Ex:
     * 
     *     if (number > 10) {
     *         // Code executed only if number is greater than 10
     *     } else {
     *         // Code executed only if number is not greater than 10
     *     }
     * 
     * Note: double bars // allow to write a comment until the end of the line. Ex:
     * 
     *     String text = "Hello"; // Assign the value "Hello" to the variable 'text'.
     * 
     * -------------------------------
     * 
     * Expected result:
     * 
     * sign(2) should return "positive"
     *
